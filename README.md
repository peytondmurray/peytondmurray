## Hi, I'm Peyton.

I'm a software engineer working at [Quansight](https://quansight.com/).

I am passionate about open source, data viz, open science, and accessibility.
I've contributed to a bunch of different open source projects, mostly in the
scientific Python ecosystem.

### Background

- During my doctoral work I studied nanoscale magnetic materials at UC Davis
  under [Kai Liu](http://kailiu.georgetown.domains/research/).
- As a postdoctoral scholar at Tampere University, I studied magnetic properties
  using computational models with the Computational Physics Laboratory under
  [Lasse Laurson](https://research.tuni.fi/cs/).
- After leaving academia, I started software engineering at
  [Voltaiq](https://www.voltaiq.com/), building battery analytics and data viz
  with Python.

### Interests

- Open source software
- Open science
- Data visualization
- Accessibility
- Developer tooling; life in the terminal
