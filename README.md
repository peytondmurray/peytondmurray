## Hi, I'm Peyton.

I'm a software engineer working at [Quansight](https://quansight.com/).

I am passionate about open source, data viz, accessibility, and open science,
and have contributed to a bunch of open source projects, mostly in the Python
data ecosystem.

### Background

- During my doctoral work I studied nanoscale magnetic materials at UC Davis
  under [Kai Liu](http://kailiu.georgetown.domains/research/).
- As a postdoctoral scholar at Tampere University, I studied magnetic properties
  using computational models.
- After leaving academia, I've worked as a software engineer on a wide range of
  projects.

### Interests

- Open source software
- Open science
- Data visualization
- Accessibility
- Developer tooling; life in the terminal
